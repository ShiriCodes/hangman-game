# Hangman Game - Python Implementation

This repository contains a step-by-step development of the classic Hangman game in Python. It was created as part of a personal learning process to improve my Python skills by building a small, interactive game.

## 📁 Contents

* **step\_1\_welcome.py** – prints the welcome screen and Hangman illustrations
* **step\_2\_input\_basics.py** – defines constants and gets first user input
* **step\_3\_display\_word.py** – displays hidden word as underscores
* **step\_4\_input\_validation.py** – adds error handling for invalid guesses
* **step\_5\_input\_function.py** – wraps input validation into a reusable function with documentation
* **step\_6\_guess\_validation.py** – checks guessed letters, updates guessed letters list, prints feedback if invalid
* **step\_7.1\_show\_hidden_word.py** – displays the current state of the secret word
* **step\_7.2\_show\_hidden\_word\_check\_win.py** – displays the current guessed state of the secret word and checks if the player has won
* **step\_8\_print\_hangman.py** – saves ASCII art of hangman as a constant and prints hangman art based on number of tries
